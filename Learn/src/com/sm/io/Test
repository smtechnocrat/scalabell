ROBERT AND JULIA JOIN THE PLANESVILLE FLYERS

PAGE 1

It was a beautiful, bright day in the tiny town of Planesville.  Robert knew it was a great day to start out on an adventure.  

“Let’s go explore the old Planesville airport,” said Robert to his sister Julia as they ran along to explore the old airport not too far from their home.  

“Yippee!” exclaimed Julia.

The first plane that Robert and Julia see is an older silver cargo plane.  "Hi there, my name is Alpha, what is yours?"  said the cargo plane.  

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

Illustration 4:  Robert and Julia are having a discussion with Beta.  Alpha is off to the side.  Robert and Julia have expressions of happiness, as does Beta.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

Illustration 5:  Alpha and Beta are in the background.  Echo and Charlie are in conversation with Robert and Julia.  Charlie has a competitive stance, as does Echo, both have smug expressions.  Robert and Julia have engaged expressions.

“Yes, Charlie and Echo are daring, but I am reliable and steady,”  said Bravo proudly. 

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.

Illustration 6:  All the planes are lined up on the runway headed for take off.  Alpha is at the front of the line just lifting into the air.  Robert and Julia are eagerly looking out of Alpha’s cockpit.

PAGE 7

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

Illustration 7:  Robert and Julia peering out from Alpha’s window, looking down on the ground below. The cars below look like small toys.


PAGE 8

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

“Look!” screamed Julia. “Charlie is falling straight out of the sky!”

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!” 

“Let’s go!” said Robert as they all headed to the control tower.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

Julia and Robert are in the control room alert and ready to respond to any radio calls from  the people of Planesville. The Planesville Flyers wait eagerly for any missions that might come their way.

“I am sure we will hear from someone soon,” said Julia. 

“But now, it is getting late,” said Robert.  “It's time to go home, but we will be back here in the control tower tomorrow.”

“Thanks for making this day very special!” exclaimed Beta.

“Thanks for showing us around,” said Julia.  “It sure was a great adventure today!" 

“See you tomorrow!” Robert called out as he and Julia walked home.

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!” 

“Let’s go!” said Robert as they all headed to the control tower.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

ROBERT AND JULIA JOIN THE PLANESVILLE FLYERS

PAGE 1

It was a beautiful, bright day in the tiny town of Planesville.  Robert knew it was a great day to start out on an adventure.  

“Let’s go explore the old Planesville airport,” said Robert to his sister Julia as they ran along to explore the old airport not too far from their home.  

“Yippee!” exclaimed Julia.

The first plane that Robert and Julia see is an older silver cargo plane.  "Hi there, my name is Alpha, what is yours?"  said the cargo plane.  

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

Illustration 3: Julia and Robert having a discussion with Alpha.  Alpha has a sad look on his face.  Julia and Robert have looks of concern on their faces.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

Illustration 4:  Robert and Julia are having a discussion with Beta.  Alpha is off to the side.  Robert and Julia have expressions of happiness, as does Beta.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

Illustration 5:  Alpha and Beta are in the background.  Echo and Charlie are in conversation with Robert and Julia.  Charlie has a competitive stance, as does Echo, both have smug expressions.  Robert and Julia have engaged expressions.

“Yes, Charlie and Echo are daring, but I am reliable and steady,”  said Bravo proudly. 

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.

Illustration 6:  All the planes are lined up on the runway headed for take off.  Alpha is at the front of the line just lifting into the air.  Robert and Julia are eagerly looking out of Alpha’s cockpit.

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

Illustration 7:  Robert and Julia peering out from Alpha’s window, looking down on the ground below. The cars below look like small toys.


PAGE 8

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

“Look!” screamed Julia. “Charlie is falling straight out of the sky!”

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!” 

“Let’s go!” said Robert as they all headed to the control tower.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

ROBERT AND JULIA JOIN THE PLANESVILLE FLYERS

It was a beautiful, bright day in the tiny town of Planesville.  Robert knew it was a great day to start out on an adventure.  

“Let’s go explore the old Planesville airport,” said Robert to his sister Julia as they ran along to explore the old airport not too far from their home.  

“Yippee!” exclaimed Julia.

The first plane that Robert and Julia see is an older silver cargo plane.  "Hi there, my name is Alpha, what is yours?"  said the cargo plane.  

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

“Yes, Charlie and Echo are daring, but I am reliable and steady,”  said Bravo proudly. 

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

Illustration 7:  Robert and Julia peering out from Alpha’s window, looking down on the ground below. The cars below look like small toys.

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

“Look!” screamed Julia. “Charlie is falling straight out of the sky!”

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!” 

“Let’s go!” said Robert as they all headed to the control tower.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

ROBERT AND JULIA JOIN THE PLANESVILLE FLYERS

PAGE 1

It was a beautiful, bright day in the tiny town of Planesville.  Robert knew it was a great day to start out on an adventure.  

“Let’s go explore the old Planesville airport,” said Robert to his sister Julia as they ran along to explore the old airport not too far from their home.  

“Yippee!” exclaimed Julia.

The first plane that Robert and Julia see is an older silver cargo plane.  "Hi there, my name is Alpha, what is yours?"  said the cargo plane.  

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

Illustration 3: Julia and Robert having a discussion with Alpha.  Alpha has a sad look on his face.  Julia and Robert have looks of concern on their faces.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

Illustration 4:  Robert and Julia are having a discussion with Beta.  Alpha is off to the side.  Robert and Julia have expressions of happiness, as does Beta.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

Illustration 5:  Alpha and Beta are in the background.  Echo and Charlie are in conversation with Robert and Julia.  Charlie has a competitive stance, as does Echo, both have smug expressions.  Robert and Julia have engaged expressions.

“Yes, Charlie and Echo are daring, but I am reliable and steady,”  said Bravo proudly. 

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.

Illustration 6:  All the planes are lined up on the runway headed for take off.  Alpha is at the front of the line just lifting into the air.  Robert and Julia are eagerly looking out of Alpha’s cockpit.

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

Illustration 7:  Robert and Julia peering out from Alpha’s window, looking down on the ground below. The cars below look like small toys.


PAGE 8

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

“Look!” screamed Julia. “Charlie is falling straight out of the sky!”

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!”

Within a few minutes, the Planesville Flyers, along with Julia and Robert , were ready for a take off. 

“One final check, please be sure to fasten your seat belts,” said Alpha. 

“Zzzzzhhhh zzhhhh,” one by one the planes were up in the sky. Julia and Robert screamed in excitement as Alpha soared into the sky. 

As Alpha climbed higher and higher, Julia looked down from the window, “Woo Hoo!  This is so much fun!”

“Wow, how did everything down below become so small? “ asked Julia.  “I can see the cars on the road near where we live, but they look as small as toys.”

“Well,” said Alpha, “I am sure our Granddaddy, Bravo, can explain it to us.”

“Bravo, please tell us why things on the ground look smaller as we climb higher into the sky.” said Alpha into the radio.

“That is an easy question to answer.  The cars don’t actually get smaller the further away they are.  It just looks that way,” explained Bravo.  “When we were on the ground, the cars were close and took up a lot of our eyes.  Now that we are up in the air, the cars are very far away and appear smaller because they take up less of our eyes.”

“Thanks Bravo, you are the brains of our team!” said Alpha.

“Look!” screamed Julia. “Charlie is falling straight out of the sky!”

“Oh no, that is just one of his tricks,” said Alpha.  “Charlie can dive down like a bird. I told you he likes to show off a bit.”  

Julia and Robert enjoyed their first airplane ride.  They wished they could fly everyday. They imagined all the places they could go and dreamed of all the things they could do. 

“Thank you so much,” said Robert.

“It would be great if we could fly with the Planesville Flyers again,”  said Julia.

“I have an idea. Why don't we show Robert and Julia the old control tower?” asked Echo.  “They may be able to listen for radio calls from the people of Planesville who may need our help.”

“That would be great!”  exclaimed Beta.  “The Planesville Flyers are ready and waiting to help the people of Planesville!” 

“Let’s go!” said Robert as they all headed to the control tower.

Beta explained to Julia and Robert that the Planesville Flyers used to get all of their missions from radio calls that came into the control tower.  Beta showed them how to use the radio.  She showed them how to use radar and maps to follow airplanes that are in flight.  There were so many buttons and gadgets.

“I am sure we will hear from someone soon,” said Julia. 

“But now, it is getting late,” said Robert.  “It's time to go home, but we will be back here in the control tower tomorrow.”

ROBERT AND JULIA JOIN THE PLANESVILLE FLYERS

PAGE 1

It was a beautiful, bright day in the tiny town of Planesville.  Robert knew it was a great day to start out on an adventure.  

“Let’s go explore the old Planesville airport,” said Robert to his sister Julia as they ran along to explore the old airport not too far from their home.  

“Yippee!” exclaimed Julia.

Illustration 1: Robert, 10 years old, short brown hair and Julia, 8 years old, blonde with pigtails. On a bright sunny afternoon, Robert and Julia are walking towards an old airport hanger in the not too distant background.

Robert and Julia are excited to see a big airplane hanger with five airplanes in it.  

Illustration 2: Robert and Julia standing just inside the hanger smiling and excited to see the 5 airplanes in front of them.

The first plane that Robert and Julia see is an older silver cargo plane.  "Hi there, my name is Alpha, what is yours?"  said the cargo plane.  

"My name is Robert and this is my sister, Julia. It sure is nice to meet you!" said Robert.

"Pleased to meet you." said Alpha. "No one has been here to visit us planes in a long time.  Why are you here?  "

"The sun is shining and the day is bright,” said Julia. “My brother and I are on an adventure today exploring this old airport."

"What are you doing here?" asked Robert.

“Oh,” said Alpha, “that is a very long story.  My friends and I were left behind a long time ago. A brand new airport was built over in Gateway City and no one really had any use for this small airport anymore."

“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Robert. “ I love airplanes, I wish I could help you.”

“Well, we think we can still be of some use, if anyone needs us.” said Alpha in a sad voice.

“Oh, don’t be sad, Alpha,” said Julia.  “I am sure my brother and I can find a way to help.” 

“Do you want to meet the rest of the Planesville Flyers?” asked Alpha as he glanced over at the other five planes.

Illustration 3: Julia and Robert having a discussion with Alpha.  Alpha has a sad look on his face.  Julia and Robert have looks of concern on their faces.

“Meet Beta, she is one of the finest training airplanes you will ever meet,” said Alpha.  “She can teach anyone how to fly.”

“Hello there,” said Beta, “I love to give flying lessons because I like meeting people and teaching them new things.  I am very excited to meet you!"

“We are happy to meet you, too!" exclaimed Robert and Julia at the same time.

Illustration 4:  Robert and Julia are having a discussion with Beta.  Alpha is off to the side.  Robert and Julia have expressions of happiness, as does Beta.

“And here is Charlie” said Alpha. “Charlie is one of the fastest aircraft and is quite a show plane.”

“Yes, I can fly fast and high,” said Charlie.  “and I can fly faster than Echo.”

“Who is Echo? “ asked Robert.

“Who is Echo?” asked Echo in a surprised voice.  “I am only the one plane that can fly faster than Charlie. I can do anything Charlie can do and I know how to do many, many tricks." 

“Wow, Charlie and Echo, you both must be very talented,” said Julia.

Illustration 5:  Alpha and Beta are in the background.  Echo and Charlie are in conversation with Robert and Julia.  Charlie has a competitive stance, as does Echo, both have smug expressions.  Robert and Julia have engaged expressions.

“Yes, Charlie and Echo are daring, but I am reliable and steady,”  said Bravo proudly. 

Robert and Julia turned to see Bravo looking wise and confident. 

“And this is Bravo,” said Alpha, “He has been around a long time and is the Granddaddy of our team.  He is smart and brave, and answers all of our questions.”

“That is very kind of you to say, Alpha.  All of us made a great team and we have accomplished many missions using all of our skills,”  said Bravo. 

“Why don’t we all go for a quick spin in the sky and show Robert and Julia what we can do?” asked Alpha. 

“Oh, that would be fun!  Let’s go for a ride,” exclaimed Robert.

“Hooray!” Julia said excitedly.  “We have never been on a plane ride before.”

“Alright then, Planesville Flyers prepare for take off!” shouted Alpha.
